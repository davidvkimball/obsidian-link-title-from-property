# Link Title From Property Obsidian Plugin

Customizes internal link suggestions to show and insert using a specified note property (frontmatter) instead of filename.

Helpful for when the filename isn't semantic or you prefer to use another property field to find and link notes.

## How To Use

1. Go to settings and specify the property to use instead of the file name.
2. Start linking notes.

As you start typing, fuzzy searches will use the specified property field instead of the file name. 

Inserting an internal link, whether it's a wikilink or a standard markdown link, will insert the property data as the hyperlinked text and automatically link it to the associated note.
